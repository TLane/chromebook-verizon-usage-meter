chromebook-verizon-usage-meter
==============================

A simple app to determine data usage on some chromebooks with Verizon Mobile Broadband.

Unfortunatly the Verizon Access Manager link disappeared from the version of ChromeOS on my Chromebook. 
So I whipped up this script to check the usage for me.


Requirements
------------

A terminal, sh, and bc.


Usage
--------

./verizon_usage.sh

There are no options.
