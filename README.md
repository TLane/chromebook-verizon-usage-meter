chromebook-verizon-usage-meter
==============================

A simple app to determine data usage on some chromebook with verizon mobile broadband.

Unfortunatly the verizon access manager link disappeared from my version of ChromeOS. 
So I whipped up this script to check the usage for me.


Requirements
------------

A terminal and bc


Usage
--------

./verizon_usage.sh

There are no options
